## Project Overview
We started this school project as a way for us to familiarize and improve our skills in using new technologies: 


## Challenges
Throughout the whole project, we were faced with a multitude of challenges:
- Creating our assets
- Designing and planning the app
- We had under one week to build the app

## Instructions
### How to run the app:
1. Install dependencies needed to run the project

```sh
npm install
```
2. Run the Dev Project

```sh
npm run dev
```

### How to play(screenshots/screen record):
1. Press quick play to enter easy mode or select “The Game” to change to hard mode
2. Drag the item into the correct recycling bin to gain a point. **If the bin in incorrect, the environment in the back will slowly deteriorate and a trash mountain will appear**
3. Get as many correct while the timer counts down **If you get 9 wrong, the game will end**
